You can surely make your own version of the library but relying on our library gives you a pleasant development experience due to its readability, documentation, and updates.\r\n\r\n_Mint_ includes numerous tools for development including common annotations, event management, functional programming, and more. These tools are used by myself and colleagues on a daily basis and we want them to be used by you too but crawling through JavaDocs isn't necessarily the best way to learn how to use our library.\r\n\r\nOn our [wiki](https://github.com/Canownueasy/mint/wiki), we try to provide readable and pleasant explanations of some of the most popular and most powerful features of _Mint_."}
