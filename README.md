  <i>Mint</i> is an open-source Java library created for use in all applications.
</p>

Our idea behind _Mint_ was to incorporate features that all applications could benefit from into one standardized library. You can surely make your own version of the library but relying on our library gives you a pleasant development experience due to its readability, documentation, and updates.

We think you'll enjoy mint because it...
* Embraces Java's type safe nature, especially when it comes to features introduced in Java 5 such as generics and annotations. You might think of _Mint_ as filling in missing features for core Java. Ideally, the language itself would provide most of the same features, but until such a language comes along, we have _Mint_.
* Helps you design better APIs, and the _Mint_ API itself sets a good example. _Mint_ is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature with at least three use cases. When in doubt, we leave it out. We build general functionality which enables you to extend _Mint_ rather than adding every feature to the core framework.
* Aims to make development and debugging easier and faster, not harder and slower. In that vein, _Mint_ steers clear of surprises and magic. You should be able to understand code with or without tools, though tools can make things even easier. When errors do occur, _Mint_ goes the extra mile to fail-fast with helpful messages.
* Includes numerous tools for development including common annotations, event management, functional programming, and more.

_Mint_ is used by myself and colleagues on a daily basis and we want it to be used by you as well but crawling through the _JavaDocs_ isn't necessarily the best way to learn how to use our library.

On our [wiki](https://github.com/Jire/mint/wiki), we try to provide readable and pleasant explanations of some of the most popular and most powerful features of _Mint_.
